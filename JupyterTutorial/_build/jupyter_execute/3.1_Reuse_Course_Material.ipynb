This document serves as a rough guide to help you get rolling after the workshop. We show how you can get the scripts and the data and how you can place it into an environment in which you can continue to play with the material. We start with the easiest solution first but also want to highlight some options which require more time and knowledge from your side.\n"

    "\n",
    "First of all we need to talk about getting the material. Each tutor prepared a Git repository with all the files that are relevant for their workshop part. In there you find e.g. the scripts and folders with files including data and documentation. You can simply click on the download button in a repository to download a Git repository as a zip file to get all the content. \n",
    "\n",
    "While that provides you with most of the things you need to get going there is one caveat. GitHub does not allow us to store large files. That means that we had to put large datasets somewhere else. So that also means you need to get them from somewhere else. This is indicated during the tutorial and one example of this is the dataset of Sophie Wolf.\n",

    "1. Get the original Github-Repository URL of your tutor (see at below)\n",

    "1. Get the original Github-Repository URL of your tutor (see below)\n",
